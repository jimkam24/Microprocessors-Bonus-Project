# Microprocessors Bonus Project

## Project Overview

This project implements and tests several LeNet-5 neural network architectures on the MNIST dataset, deployed on an STM32 microcontroller.

## Key Features

* Model Training: Different LeNet-5 variations were trained on MNIST to compare accuracy and performance.

* Deployment on STM32: The trained models were converted and loaded onto an STM32 board for real-time inference.

* UART Communication: The STM32 communicates with the host computer via UART to display classification results and performance statistics.

## Outcome

The project demonstrates how deep learning models can be deployed on resource-constrained embedded systems, highlighting the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency when running on microcontrollers.
